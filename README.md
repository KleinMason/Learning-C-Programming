## GPT Learning Path

### Learning path

1. Basic Concepts [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - History of C
  - Compiling and running a C program
  - Variables, data types, operators
  - Input/Output (printf, scanf)
  - Control structures (if-else, loops)
- Project:
  - Write a basic calculator program that can handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. Functions and Modular Programming [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - Function declarations and definitions
  - Passing parameters (by value)
  - Scope of variables (local vs. global)
  - Recursion in C
- Project:
  - Implement a program that calculates the factorial of a number using both iterative and recursive functions.

3. Arrays and Strings [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - Arrays (1D and 2D)
  - String manipulation (string.h functions)
  - Multi-dimensional arrays
- Project:
  - Create a program that sorts an array of integers using Bubble Sort.
  - Build a string manipulation tool that can reverse a string, count vowels, and compare two strings.

4. Pointers [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - Pointer basics (declaration, dereferencing)
  - Pointer arithmetic
  - Passing pointers to functions
  - Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free)
  - Relationship between arrays and pointers
- Project:
  - Implement a dynamic array (vector) that can grow as more elements are added.
  - Create a pointer-based implementation of a string reversal function.

5. Structures [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - Defining and using structs
  - Pointers to structs
  - Nested structs
  - Arrays of structs
- Project:
  - Write a program that manages student records (name, ID, grades) using structures. Implement functions to add, update, and display student data.

6. File I/O [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - Reading from and writing to files
  - Handling text and binary files
  - File operations (fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, fscanf, fprintf)
- Project:
  - Create a contact book that reads/writes contact information (name, phone, email) to/from a file.

7. Memory Management and Optimization [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - Memory management (stack vs. heap)
  - Proper use of dynamic memory (malloc, calloc, realloc, free)
  - Common memory issues (memory leaks, dangling pointers)
  - Optimizing C code for performance
- Project:
  - Implement a memory allocator similar to malloc and free.

8. Advanced Topics [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - Command-line arguments (argc, argv)
  - Bitwise operations
  - Preprocessor directives (#define, #include, #ifdef)
  - Using makefiles for building larger projects
- Project:
  - Implement a simple command-line tool to perform operations like file copy, search, and word count.

9. Data Structures [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - Linked Lists (single, double)
  - Stacks and Queues (using arrays and linked lists)
  - Trees (binary trees, traversals)
  - Hashing (basic hash table implementation)
- Project:
  - Implement a basic text editor with undo/redo functionality using linked lists to store the text buffer.

10. Algorithms [ ]

- What to Learn:
  - Sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
  - Searching algorithms (Binary Search)
  - Greedy algorithms and dynamic programming basics
- Project:
- Implement a file compression tool using Huffman coding algorithm.

### Capstone Project: Build a Basic Operating System Shell

- Project Scope:
  - Implement a simple shell (command interpreter) that can:
  - Execute basic commands (like ls, cd, mkdir)
  - Handle piping and redirection (|, >, <)
  - Support background tasks using &
  - Implement custom commands like history and exit
- Skills Covered:
  - Working with system calls (fork, exec, wait)
  - Advanced use of pointers, strings, and structures
  - File I/O and memory management
  - Process management and inter-process communication
