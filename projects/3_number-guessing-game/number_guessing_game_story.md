# Project Story: Number Guessing Game

You are creating a simple but engaging number guessing game to test your skills with loops, conditionals, and user input in C. The game works like this:

1. The computer randomly selects a number within a predefined range, for example, 1 to 100.
2. The playerâ€™s task is to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the program gives feedback:
   - "Too high!" if the guess is larger than the correct number.
   - "Too low!" if the guess is smaller.
4. The game keeps track of the number of attempts.
5. When the player guesses the number correctly, the program congratulates them and displays the number of attempts they took.
6. The player can then choose to play again or exit.

## Features you can implement:
- Random number generation (using the `rand()` function).
- Input handling (with `scanf()`).
- Loops (to keep the game running until the correct guess).
- Conditionals (to compare the guess with the target number).
- Option to play again or exit.

This project will help you practice core C concepts while building a fun, interactive game!
